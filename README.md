# R-Shiny-Project

##For my shiny project, I decided to analyze a data set of Netflix Movie and TV Show Titles from late 2000s to present day. With 12 columns, stacked with 7,787 rows of data, I was able to extract a sizable amount of valuable information portrayed in this shiny app. With this information, I was able to analyze and create visual representation of common trends that have taken place over the course of the lifespan of Netflix.  This analysis covers title count, genre, duration, ratings, casting recurrence and more.
